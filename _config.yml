description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  As we bid farewell to 2024, let's review the year and the path it carved. I spoke at a conference and earned by second film credit. I took part in several industry events, enhancing my existing skills and learning new ones. Put together a Making Of for my year in review series, shipped some awesome new software products and took some awesome photos during my travels.
